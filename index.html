            <h2>What are you?</h2>

            <p>
                We are 󱤑󱦐󱤝󱥤󱦑 We all live inside one single body, 
                and we are very good at creating internal worlds,
                or "Headspaces".
            </p>

            <h2>How do I Read More about You?</h2>
 
            <p>Just click on the links on top, and browse! This 
                website is still a work in progress, so may things 
                may not be finished - but we're doing the best we 
                can!
            </p>

                Nasin nanpa!</a> It's a toki pona font we've grown
                fond of. You don't have to download it (although if
                you're experiencing problems with it, I suggest you 
                do). <br> 󱤑󱦐󱤮󱤺󱥺󱦑 is the one who knows toki pona 
                the most, but we as a collective - or a 󱤟, if you 
                will - we all speak it.<br>
                For all toki pona speakers, we have a weird way of
                writing our names as you may have noticed. Sorry 
                about that!

                Our headspace has a weird history. If you
                want to know about it, go

            <h2>The Nexus, 󱦐󱤌󱤩󱦑</h2>
            
            <p>
                The Nexus is the name of the current Headspace we have. It's 
                structurally complicated, architecturally impossible, and 
                pretty cool to look at with your eyes (or I guess whatever you
                use to look at stuff in the headspace).<br>
                󱤑󱦐󱤮󱤺󱥺󱦑 has made a drawing of the headspace (which, like the 
                real thing, is forever changing). Here it is, with annotations
                for a better understanding
            </p>

                    <li>
                        <div class="color">#8b8a9c</div> The moon. It's not 
                        actually a moon, as in it doesn't orbit anything and 
                        has no effect on anything, but it's very pretty to
                        look at. You can even go up there.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <div class="color">#5c448d</div> The moon base. It's
                        a wizard-y structure with a very long spiral staircase
                        that takes you to an observatory where you can look at
                        stars that don't actually exist. A pretty fun activity!

                    <li>
                        <div class="color">#d2d1b3</div> 󱦁󱦐󱥪󱥦󱦑's house. It's
                        pretty far from the other houses, but he doesn't mind 
                        as he can just teleport to them. It's in the shape of a 
                        skull and no one - not even him - knows why. It was chosen
                        at random while scrolling through pinterest.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        <div class="color">#5153bc</div> 󱤑󱦐󱤮󱤺󱥺󱦑's and 󱤑󱦐󱥎󱤾󱦑's 
                        houses. They're the same as they were in the Ocean. This time 
                        they're in a pond, which while less exciting makes the presence
                        of all the insects make slightly more sense. The water still
                        is not wet (or rather - doesn't make you wet. The question of
                        whether water is intrinsically wet or not is one for another day).
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <div class="color">#cdca76</div> The Sunflowers. There is a field
                        of sunflowers that always look at you (even when there are other 
                        people) that covers a rectangular structure that takes you to the 
                        areas of the headspace.

                <p>
                    There's other places in our headspace, but they will either be
                    added later or they will never be added for personal reasons.
