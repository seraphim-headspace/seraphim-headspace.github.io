    Don't ask me why, but for some reason I can't put this code in the <head>
    section of the html file (wrapped in a DOMContentLoaded event listener)
    without everything breaking and me not being able to change page. 
    With that in mind, please do not move it from the bottom of the html file
    thank you very much :)
